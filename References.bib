                 (pO2) are thought to be closely tied to the evolution of life,
                 with strong feedbacks between uni- and multicellular life and
                 oxygen1, 2. On the geologic timescale, pO2 is regulated by the
                 burial of organic carbon and sulphur, as well as by
                 weathering3. Reconstructions of atmospheric O2 for the past
                 400 million years have therefore been based on geochemical
                 models of carbon and sulphur cycling4, 5, 6. However, these
                 reconstructions vary widely4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, particularly
                 for the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic eras. Here we show that
                 the abundance of charcoal in mire settings is controlled by
                 pO2, and use this proxy to reconstruct the concentration of
                 atmospheric oxygen for the past 400 million years. We estimate
                 that pO2 was continuously above 26\% during the Carboniferous
                 and Permian periods, and that it declined abruptly around the
                 time of the Permian--Triassic mass extinction. During the
                 Triassic and Jurassic periods, pO2 fluctuated cyclically, with
                 amplitudes up to 10\% and a frequency of 20--30 million years.
                 Atmospheric oxygen concentrations have declined steadily from
                 the middle of the Cretaceous period to present-day values of
                 about 21\%. We conclude, however, that variation in pO2 was
                 not the main driver of the loss of faunal diversity during the
                 Permo--Triassic and Triassic--Jurassic mass extinction events.",

                 and isotopic composition of sedimentary rocks, indicate that
                 atmospheric O2 has varied appreciably over Phanerozoic time,
                 with a notable excursion during the Permo-Carboniferous
                 reaching levels as high as 35\% O2. This agrees with
                 measurements of the carbon isotopic composition of fossil
                 plants together with experiments and calculations on the
                 effect of O2 on photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation.
                 The principal cause of the excursion was the rise of large
                 vascular land plants and the consequent increased global
                 burial of organic matter. Higher levels of O2 are consistent
                 with the presence of Permo-Carboniferous giant insects, and
                 preliminary experiments indicate that insect body size can
                 increase with elevated O2. Higher O2 also may have caused more
                 extensive, possibly catastrophic, wildfires. To check this,
                 realistic burning experiments are needed to examine the
                 effects of elevated O2 on fire behavior.",

                 locomotor physiology and animal flight performance have
                 generally presupposed the constancy of atmospheric
                 composition. Recent geophysical data as well as theoretical
                 models suggest that, to the contrary, both oxygen and carbon
                 dioxide concentrations have changed dramatically during
                 defining periods of metazoan evolution. Hyperoxia in the late
                 Paleozoic atmosphere may have physiologically enhanced the
                 initial evolution of tetrapod locomotor energetics; a
                 concurrently hyperdense atmosphere would have augmented
                 aerodynamic force production in early flying insects. Multiple
                 historical origins of vertebrate flight also correlate
                 temporally with geological periods of increased oxygen
                 concentration and atmospheric density. Arthropod as well as
                 amphibian gigantism appear to have been facilitated by a
                 hyperoxic Carboniferous atmosphere and were subsequently
                 eliminated by a late Permian transition to hypoxia. For extant
                 organisms, the transient, chronic and ontogenetic effects of
                 exposure to hyperoxic gas mixtures are poorly understood
                 relative to contemporary understanding of the physiology of
                 oxygen deprivation. Experimentally, the biomechanical and
                 physiological effects of hyperoxia on animal flight
                 performance can be decoupled through the use of gas mixtures
                 that vary in density and oxygen concentration. Such
                 manipulations permit both paleophysiological simulation of
                 ancestral locomotor performance and an analysis of maximal

                 Proterozoic Eon as well as episodic fluctuations in oxygen
                 over several million-year time spans during the Phanerozoic
                 Era, have arguably exerted strong selective forces on cellular
                 and organismic respiratory specialization and evolution. The
                 rise in atmospheric oxygen, some 2 billion years after the
                 origin of life, dramatically altered cell biology and set the
                 stage for the appearance of multicelluar life forms in the
                 Vendian (Ediacaran) Period of the Neoproterozoic Era. Over
                 much of the Paleozoic, the level of oxygen in the atmosphere
                 was near the present atmospheric level (21\%). In the Late
                 Paleozoic, however, there were extended times during which the
                 level of atmospheric oxygen was either markedly lower or
                 markedly higher than 21\%. That these Paleozoic shifts in
                 atmospheric oxygen affected the biota is suggested by the
                 correlations between: (1) Reduced oxygen and the occurrences
                 of extinctions, a lowered biodiversity and shifts in phyletic
                 succession, and (2) During hyperoxia, the corresponding
                 occurrence of phenomena such as arthropod gigantism, the
                 origin of insect flight, and the evolution of vertebrate
                 terrestriality. Basic similarities in features of adaptation

                 mechanisms responsive to fluctuations in ambient oxygen.

                 bases of phenotypic adjustments to cyclic oxygen fluctuation
